# C-and-HTML
Using C# we create a program that reads from a dtc code file and creates a webpage out of it 

 *Here is where the current train of thought is going with this application.
  - The program will take in a text file that has dtc data captured from VCDS. 
  - Then it will output it in nice formatted Webpage. 
  - I like doing things the hard way, so that way I can learn.
