Following the UPDATE TO THIS REPO file I made earlier, I detailed how I 
wanted the webpage to look like after C# read the text file and 
converted it to a style of webpage that I wanted.
Here is that code of HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Same as FileName</title>
</head>
<body class="container">
<!-- Start your code here -->
  
    <p class="lw"> Date: Wednesday,01,May,2019,17:20:20:05102!</p>
  
      <div class="ecu-info">
        <p>Address 01: Engine       Labels: 06B-909-518-AMB.lbl</p> 
        <p>Control Module Part Number: 8E0 909 518 AK    HW: 8E0 909 018 A</p>
        <p>Component and/or Version: 1.8L R4/5VT     G02 0004</p>
        <!-- Please note that the ecu-info array contains 6 lines of info with the VCDS id
             being the last one. But I will keep that info from displaying. -->
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>

*Things to note. The dtc-info class as well as the comments class are not static.
Ie the file could contain multiple lines of DTC's that the program (VCDS) wrote to the file. SO the array could be size of n.
Detailing what i see lets break it down:

1 Fault Found:                                                                // In C# this is line 0
            16683 - Boost Pressure Regulation                                 //After we have inof on the DTC
            P0299 - 002 - Control Range Not Reached - Intermittent - MIL ON   //So a DTC is 2 lines (1 is info on DTC, 2 is detail)
            Readiness: 0010 1001                                              //Readiness marks the end of the DTC, dont really need it
            
The same could be said for the comments section of this.. 
Comments can be of array length 1, to n. but mainly my concern and reason for writing this
is that in my algorithm I will have to make sure that I read and keep all the dtc's of size n in one array and to write it 
to the new html file with the <p></p> element wrapped around it.
