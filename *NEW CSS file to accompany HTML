Alright here is the CSS code that will make my webpage of DTC a lil more to the style of Guillermo.
Resources:
The color pallet called Beach Towels and it can be found here:

.container {
  background: black;
  text-align: center;
  height: 100px;
  
  
}
.lw { 
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 30px;
  color:  #fed766;
}
.ecu-info{
  color: #2ab7ca;
  background:  #f4f4f8;
  width: 50%;
  text-align: center;
  display: inline-block;
}
.dtc-info{
  color:#fe4a49;
  text-align: left;
}
.comments{
  text-align: left;
  color: #009900;
}

Simple and to the point, this will be updated later as more and more ideas are coming to my head. 
Also I want to research how to stylize, or better understanding of margin paddin and borders to make this pop a little more.
